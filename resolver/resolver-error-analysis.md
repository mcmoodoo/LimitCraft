# Resolver Order Filling Error Analysis

## Error Summary

The resolver is encountering multiple issues when attempting to fill orders from the database, despite successful order reconstruction with the saved salt value.

## Error Details

### 1. Predicate Check Error

```
⚠️ Could not check predicate, proceeding anyway: TypeError: unsupported addressable value (argument="target", value=null, code=INVALID_ARGUMENT)
```

**Issue:** Some address fields in the order struct are `undefined` or `null` when passed to the contract.

**Evidence from SDK output:**
- `allowedSender: undefined` 
- `interactions: undefined`

### 2. Order Reconstruction Issues

**Expected Contract ABI (10 fields):**
```solidity
(uint256 salt, address makerAsset, address takerAsset, address maker, 
 address receiver, address allowedSender, uint256 makingAmount, 
 uint256 takingAmount, uint256 offsets, bytes interactions)
```

**Actual Reconstructed Struct (6 fields):**
```javascript
{
  salt: "48168577462233318843246980834",
  maker: "0xa53568e4175835369d6f76b93501dd6789ab0b41",
  makerAsset: "0xaf88d065e77c8cc2239327c5edb3a432268e5831",
  takerAsset: "0x82af49447d8a07e3bd95bd0d56f35241523fbab1",
  makingAmount: "1",
  takingAmount: "2000000000000000000",
}
```

**Missing Fields:**
- `receiver`
- `allowedSender` 
- `offsets`
- `interactions`

### 3. Contract Execution Error

```
❌ Error filling order: execution reverted (unknown custom error) (action="estimateGas", data="0x70a03f48")
```

**Contract Address:** `0x111111125421cA6dc452d289314280a0f8842A65` (1inch Limit Order Protocol)

**Error Data:** `0x70a03f48` (unknown custom error)

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Malformed Order Struct:** The `reconstructOrderStruct` method is not properly handling `undefined` values from the SDK and not including all required fields for the contract call.

2. **Address Field Issues:** The ethers.js contract expects all struct fields to be properly defined, but `undefined` values are being passed as `null`/`0x0` addresses.

3. **Contract Rejection:** The 1inch contract is rejecting the order due to:
   - Incomplete order struct
   - Invalid address fields
   - Potentially expired order or insufficient allowances

## Recommended Fixes

1. **Complete Order Struct:** Ensure all 10 required fields are included in the contract call
2. **Handle Undefined Values:** Convert `undefined` SDK values to appropriate defaults (e.g., `0x0` addresses, empty bytes)
3. **Validate Order Data:** Check order expiration and token allowances before attempting to fill
4. **Debug Contract Error:** Decode the custom error `0x70a03f48` to understand the specific rejection reason

## Current Status

- ✅ Salt value is correctly saved and retrieved from database
- ✅ LimitOrder reconstruction with SDK is working
- ❌ Order struct preparation for contract call is incomplete
- ❌ Contract execution fails due to malformed parameters
